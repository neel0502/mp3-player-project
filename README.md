# mp3-player-project
Hi,So this is a basic Mp3 player which I did for my college project Using Python and Tkinter
There is a PPt in which you can see my approach and a overview of my project and also there is a walkthrough video where you can see how to use the application.
I have attached icons their location  should be updated in the code as per the users location
I have also attached songs they can be placed anywhere on your pc and there is no change rewuired in the code for it
Thank you
